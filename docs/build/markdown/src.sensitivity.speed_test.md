# src.sensitivity.speed_test

Speed Test
This is a script with some functions to run speed and accuracy tests on test models constructed with babymodel.

It can be run directly. Parameter values are at the top of the file and any desired value can be entered into the declarations.
The script will then run a sequence of functions to time the build, sympification, and sensitivity calculation for the TestBabyModel
constructed with those input values.

### src.sensitivity.speed_test.run_timed(params, parameter_name)

generates an instance of TestBabyModel with given parameters, sympifies it, and follows the sequence of steps
: to get the sensitivity matrix. Prints times for each step.

* **Parameters:**
  * **params** (*dict*) – dictionary of parameter values for the TestBabyModel instance generated. These are set in the beginning of the script.
    Values can be changed in the declaration statements.
  * **parameter_name** (*str*) – the name of the scalar parameter to evaluate sensitivities with respect to.
* **Returns:**
  tuple of model to be solved, the sympification of the model, the SensitivityMatrix, DifferentialMapping associated with parameter and model solve values
* **Return type:**
  tuple

### src.sensitivity.speed_test.speed_accuracy_test(params, parameter_name, p)

performs a run_timed execution with given parameters, takes the returned values, and measures the effect of increasing and
: decreasing the named parameter by p, and compares the result to resolving the model with that same perturbation.

* **Returns:**
  * **params** (*dict*) – dictionary of parameter values for the TestBabyModel instance generated. These are set in the beginning of the script.
    Values can be changed in the declaration statements.
  * **parameter_name** (*str*) – the name of the scalar parameter to evaluate sensitivities with respect to.
  * **p** (*float*) – percentage change up and down to be measured, as a decimal.
